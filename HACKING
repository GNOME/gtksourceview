Coding Style
============

All new code in GtkSourceView should follow the GNOME Programming Guidelines
(http://developer.gnome.org/doc/guides/programming-guidelines/), except
braces for which we prefer the "hanging" style. I.e.:

	if (x)
	{
		code_block;
	}

Braces are optional if code_block is just one line of code, but be
consistent for multiple branched statements suchs as if/else if/else.

If you add new API to GtkSourceView you must provide gtk-doc style
comments fully documenting all the functions you're adding.

Subversion guidelines for gtksourceview
=======================================

Please don't commit directly to the subversion repository unless you have
been given the green light to commit freely to gtksourceview.  
When in doubt assume you haven't ;-). 

Please submit patches to bugzilla.gnome.org. We will review
them with much pleasure.

If you are a translator feel free to mark strings for translation,
fix typos in the code, etc.

Please send patches for build & configure fixes too.  

We really appreciate your help, we just want to review these fixes 
before applying.

If you are a "build sheriff", feel free to commit fixes for build and 
configure (please, send us an e-mail with the patch you have applied).


Thanks,

  the GtkSourceView team
