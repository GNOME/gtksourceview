News in 5.4.2, 2022-06-12
-------------------------

 * Updated languages: c.lang, perl.lang
 * Updated style-schemes: Adwaita-dark, solarized-light, solarized-dark
 * Updated translations: Friulian
 * Gutter renderers are now provided a prelight quark for lines when the
   pointer is over the gutter.
 * Hover assistants now avoid synthesized motion which is used much more
   often in GTK 4 when dealing with crossing-events.
 * Hover assistants will now dismiss themselves when the cursor moves.
 * GtkSourceMap has reduced how often it needs to do allocation by ignoring
   spurious notify::upper and value-changed signals from GtkTextView's
   vertical GtkAdjustment.
 * The testsuite has gained some correctness improvements thanks to
   issues pointed out by SÃ©bastien Wilmet.
 * The Vim emulation's register implementation is now shared between buffers
   as it would be expected in Vim.
 * Snippets have gained some robustness improvements including the ability
   to simplify results from the snippet parser, more defensive behavior,
   and being lazier when possible.
 * Tabbing through focus-positions in snippets will now immediately jump
   to the new position if scrolling is required instead of animating as
   it results in better placement of tooltip assistants.
 * Assistants including completion, hover, and interactive tooltips now
   reduce how often they request presentation and position calculation from
   GDK and ultimately display servers such as Wayland.
 * Completion windows now take the size of the gutter into account when
   calculating their position relative to the parent GtkWindow so that the
   typed-text column remains aligned with typed text in the source view.
 * Completion has gained robustness improvements to do less work when
   possible and avoid spinning the frame-clock which could happen in
   certain scenarios.

It is recommended that distributions update to this release if they are
already shipping a GtkSourceView 5.4.x release.

 * Translation updates.

News in 5.3.0, 2021-12-08
-------------------------

This is a development release as we progress towards GNOME 42. It is
not a stable release and is intended for testing purposes.

 * Documentation has been updated to use gi-docgen.
 * Style schemes now support the <metadata> tag similar to languages.
   This can be used by style schemes to denote if they are light or dark
   mode and a relative scheme for use when desktop dark mode preferences
   have changed.
 * Selections for most style schemes bundled with GtkSourceView are now
   translucent and do not modify the foreground color. This performs very
   well now that we have GL based rendering in GTK.
 * The Vala bindings have moved from the Gtk namespace to the GtkSource
   namespace to match the bindings in all other languages. While it is
   unfortunate that this has happened after 5.0, it is still early enough
   that we can avoid having to maintain a clashing namespace with Gtk.
 * A new Vim emulator in the form of GtkSourceVimIMContext. This can emulate
   basic features such as Normal, Insert, Replace, Visual, Visual Line, and
   Command Bar modes. Additionally, many Vim-style motions and text-objects
   are supported. Registers, Marks, and Jumplists are also partially suppored.
   The + and * registers can be used to integrate with both the system and
   primary GDK clipboards. Various commands are available in teh command bar
   such as nohl, set, :s, :join, and more.
 * Updated language specs: rst.lang, c.lang, cpp.lang, vala.lang, spice.lang,
   lean.lang, and yara.lang.
 * Updated style schemes which improve the quality of output when used with
   non-standard GTK themes.
 * A new GtkSourceStyleSchemePreview widget.
 * The GtkSourceStyleSchemeChooserWidget now uses GtkSourceStyleSchemePreview
   to display style schemes.
 * Improve autocompletion styling when used with libadwaita.
 * Improvements to cell alignment in the gutter particularly useful when
   the CSS line-height attribute is used.
 * Many fit-n-finish improvements to GtkSourceMap.
 * The gutter line renderer now adapts to more situations where it will
   need to redraw based on highlight-current-line.
 * Build system improvements.
 * Translation updates.

News in 5.0.0, 2021-03-19
-------------------------

GtkSourceView 5.0 is the first stable release of GtkSourceView targeting the
GTK 4 toolkit. It is the culmination of about a year of development.

Numerous new features were added that are not available in the 4.8 series of
GtkSourceView.

Notably:

 * A new GListModel-based completion engine with a refresh on autocompletion
   interface styling which was upstreamed from GNOME Builder.
 * Syntax languages are now implemented using PCRE2 instead of GRegex which
   also allowed for enabling the PCRE2 JIT for faster syntax highlighting.
 * GtkSourceView can now integrate with Sysprof to generate performance
   information. This may be helpful to application developers to help optimize
   application rendering on GTK 4.
 * Many internal components have become native GtkWidgets.
 * A new code-snippet engine with an XML-based language have been added which
   were upstreamed from GNOME Builder.
 * Support for interactive tooltips using GtkSourceHover which was upstreamed
   from GNOME Builder.
 * You can now write custom indenters using GtkSourceIndenter which was
   upstreamed from GNOME Builder.
 * The overview map now bundles a custom "BuilderBlocks" font which was
   upstreamed from GNOME Builder.
 * Undo management is now part of GTK 4.
 * Translation updates.


News in 4.99.0, 2021-02-12
--------------------------

GtkSourceView 4.99.0 is a beta release targeting GTK 4 and will eventually
become GtkSourceView 5.0.

It is the largest release of GtkSourceView in many releases and contains new
subsystems and performance improvements. More than 300 commits are part of this
release touching everything from syntax highlighting to a new snippet engine.

As GtkSourceView 4.99 moves to using PCRE2, it is possible that some language
definitions will need tweaking for differences between PCRE and PCRE2. So far,
very few changes were necessary within the GtkSourceView codebase but external
language specifications may require some tweaks. In particular, improper
escaping is the only incompatability seen thus far.

* Improvements when converting Pango styling to CSS
* Build system improvements
* GObject modernization
* A new completion engine has been added that reduces overhead and fits with
  GTK 4 lazy lists more closely. It is largely based on the code and design
  from GNOME Builder.
* GtkSourceGutterRenderers are now a GtkWidget allowing more interesting
  features to be implemented by applications.
* Undo management was moved into GTK 4 directly and is no longer part of
  GtkSourceView.
* Syntax highlighting has moved to PCRE2 and utilizes a JIT when available.
* GtkSourceBuffer has a new "cursor-moved" signal.
* A new font "Builder Blocks" from GNOME Builder has been bundled for use
  in the GtkSourceMap.
* To speed up gutter operations, a new GtkSourceLines abstraction has been
  added which allows fewer passes across the source buffer to extract features
  for display.
* A new snippet engine based originally upon GNOME Builder's but with a
  new snippet language based on XML similar to language-specs and
  style-schemes.
* A new "Assistant" abstraction which can be used for tooltips and eventually
  hover providers.
* Updates to go.lang, cmake.lang, meson.lang, csharp.lang.
* Translation updates

schemes this cycle. The number of improvements you see above are largely an
example of their quality reviews and improvements!
