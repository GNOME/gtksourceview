News in 5.3.2, 2022-01-09
-------------------------

This is a development release as we progress towards GNOME 42. It is
not a stable release and is intended for testing purposes.

 * Support ctrl+shift+v in Vim insert mode to paste similar to terminal
 * Improve placement of H/L movements in Vim emulation
 * Various build system improvements
 * Fix running testsuite before installation
 * Bump GTK required version to match actual requirements in code
 * Remove CSS line-height usage until we can depend on GTK 4.6

News in 5.3.1, 2022-01-06
-------------------------

This is a development release as we progress towards GNOME 42. It is
not a stable release and is intended for testing purposes.

 * python3.lang: add support for .pyi glob and f-strings.
 * c.lang: Hightlight _t and _T types.
 * rust.lang: You can now style lifetime and self in style schemes.
 * javascript.lang: Support for shebang's have been added.
 * GObject Introspection improvements.
 * Fixes to work around improper selections in some style-schemes.
 * Vim: many improvements to and compatibility fixes in emulation.
 * Tracing: More modules now use sysprof for tracing information.
 * Ctrl+shift+u works again when auto-indent is enabled, which was
   stealing input before ctrl+shift+u could process the unicode input.
 * Gutter renderers now more aggresively cache color information for
   drawing highlights and more.
 * GtkSourceGutterRendererLines avoids using GMarkup just for bold
   attributes as using a single referenced PangoAttrList is faster.
 * Adwaita and Adwaita-dark have been updated and improved along with
   more specific highlighting for a number of languages.
 * You can now set `bold="false"` on current-line-number to disable
   bold weight on the current line number.
 * Drawing of background grids have been improved when margins are used
   as well as trying harder to align to the character grid and taking
   CSS line-height into account when possible.
 * Current line number is no longer drawn specially when selections are
   active. The highlight-current-line is also disabled during selections.
 * GtkSourceFileLoader now tries to use aligned pages when loading
   buffers from storage and reads in a multiple of the page size.
 * Build fixes for macOS.
 * Translation updates.

News in 5.3.0, 2021-12-08
-------------------------

This is a development release as we progress towards GNOME 42. It is
not a stable release and is intended for testing purposes.

 * Documentation has been updated to use gi-docgen.
 * Style schemes now support the <metadata> tag similar to languages.
   This can be used by style schemes to denote if they are light or dark
   mode and a relative scheme for use when desktop dark mode preferences
   have changed.
 * Selections for most style schemes bundled with GtkSourceView are now
   translucent and do not modify the foreground color. This performs very
   well now that we have GL based rendering in GTK.
 * The Vala bindings have moved from the Gtk namespace to the GtkSource
   namespace to match the bindings in all other languages. While it is
   unfortunate that this has happened after 5.0, it is still early enough
   that we can avoid having to maintain a clashing namespace with Gtk.
 * A new Vim emulator in the form of GtkSourceVimIMContext. This can emulate
   basic features such as Normal, Insert, Replace, Visual, Visual Line, and
   Command Bar modes. Additionally, many Vim-style motions and text-objects
   are supported. Registers, Marks, and Jumplists are also partially suppored.
   The + and * registers can be used to integrate with both the system and
   primary GDK clipboards. Various commands are available in teh command bar
   such as nohl, set, :s, :join, and more.
 * Updated language specs: rst.lang, c.lang, cpp.lang, vala.lang, spice.lang,
   lean.lang, and yara.lang.
 * Updated style schemes which improve the quality of output when used with
   non-standard GTK themes.
 * A new GtkSourceStyleSchemePreview widget.
 * The GtkSourceStyleSchemeChooserWidget now uses GtkSourceStyleSchemePreview
   to display style schemes.
 * Improve autocompletion styling when used with libadwaita.
 * Improvements to cell alignment in the gutter particularly useful when
   the CSS line-height attribute is used.
 * Many fit-n-finish improvements to GtkSourceMap.
 * The gutter line renderer now adapts to more situations where it will
   need to redraw based on highlight-current-line.
 * Build system improvements.
 * Translation updates.

News in 5.2.0, 2021-09-03
-------------------------

GtkSourceView 5.2.0 is the release corresponding with GNOME 41.0 for
GTK 4-based applications. We expect performance improvements when
combined with GTK 4.4's NGL renderer, especially on HiDPI systems.

Changes since 5.1.0

   text area. kate.xml uses this to more closely match Kate.

 * Improvements to YARA syntax.

 * Translation updates

News in 5.0.0, 2021-03-19
-------------------------

GtkSourceView 5.0 is the first stable release of GtkSourceView targeting the
GTK 4 toolkit. It is the culmination of about a year of development.

Numerous new features were added that are not available in the 4.8 series of
GtkSourceView.

Notably:

 * A new GListModel-based completion engine with a refresh on autocompletion
   interface styling which was upstreamed from GNOME Builder.
 * Syntax languages are now implemented using PCRE2 instead of GRegex which
   also allowed for enabling the PCRE2 JIT for faster syntax highlighting.
 * GtkSourceView can now integrate with Sysprof to generate performance
   information. This may be helpful to application developers to help optimize
   application rendering on GTK 4.
 * Many internal components have become native GtkWidgets.
 * A new code-snippet engine with an XML-based language have been added which
   were upstreamed from GNOME Builder.
 * Support for interactive tooltips using GtkSourceHover which was upstreamed
   from GNOME Builder.
 * You can now write custom indenters using GtkSourceIndenter which was
   upstreamed from GNOME Builder.
 * The overview map now bundles a custom "BuilderBlocks" font which was
   upstreamed from GNOME Builder.
 * Undo management is now part of GTK 4.
 * Translation updates.


News in 4.99.0, 2021-02-12
--------------------------

GtkSourceView 4.99.0 is a beta release targeting GTK 4 and will eventually
become GtkSourceView 5.0.

It is the largest release of GtkSourceView in many releases and contains new
subsystems and performance improvements. More than 300 commits are part of this
release touching everything from syntax highlighting to a new snippet engine.

As GtkSourceView 4.99 moves to using PCRE2, it is possible that some language
definitions will need tweaking for differences between PCRE and PCRE2. So far,
very few changes were necessary within the GtkSourceView codebase but external
language specifications may require some tweaks. In particular, improper
escaping is the only incompatability seen thus far.

* Improvements when converting Pango styling to CSS
* Build system improvements
* GObject modernization
* A new completion engine has been added that reduces overhead and fits with
  GTK 4 lazy lists more closely. It is largely based on the code and design
  from GNOME Builder.
* GtkSourceGutterRenderers are now a GtkWidget allowing more interesting
  features to be implemented by applications.
* Undo management was moved into GTK 4 directly and is no longer part of
  GtkSourceView.
* Syntax highlighting has moved to PCRE2 and utilizes a JIT when available.
* GtkSourceBuffer has a new "cursor-moved" signal.
* A new font "Builder Blocks" from GNOME Builder has been bundled for use
  in the GtkSourceMap.
* To speed up gutter operations, a new GtkSourceLines abstraction has been
  added which allows fewer passes across the source buffer to extract features
  for display.
* A new snippet engine based originally upon GNOME Builder's but with a
  new snippet language based on XML similar to language-specs and
  style-schemes.
* A new "Assistant" abstraction which can be used for tooltips and eventually
  hover providers.
* Updates to go.lang, cmake.lang, meson.lang, csharp.lang.
* Translation updates

  unicode and improved heredoc
* sh.lang: Many improvements including various GNU bash extensions
* meson.lang: Support for string escape sequences
* javascript.lang: Redesign of JavaScript language spec to be more flexible
  and reusable from other languages which support JS.
* jsx.lang: Initial support for JSX
* jsdoc.lang: Initial support for JSDoc
* objj.lang: Improvements using javascript improvements
* asciidoc.lang: Improvements to use more generic markup styling

they have put into reviewing and improving both language specs and style
schemes this cycle. The number of improvements you see above are largely an
example of their quality reviews and improvements!
