== Basic text formatting ==

You can ''italicize'' text by putting 2 apostrophes on ''each'' side. 

3 apostrophes will '''bold''' the text. 

5 apostrophes will '''''bold and italicize''''' the text.

(Using 4 apostrophes doesn't do anything special -- <br /> 3 of them '''bold''' the text as usual; the others are ''''just'''' apostrophes around the text.)

----

A single newline generally has no effect on the layout. These can be used to separate sentences within a paragraph. Some editors find that this aids editing and improves the ''diff'' function (used internally to compare different versions of a page).

But an empty line starts a new paragraph.

When used in a list, a newline ''does'' affect the layout ([[#lists|see below]]).

----

You can break lines<br/>
without a new paragraph.<br/>
Please use this sparingly.

Please do not start a link or ''italics'' or '''bold''' text on one line and end on the next.

----

You should "sign" your comments on talk pages:
* Three tildes gives your signature: ~~~
* Four tildes give your signature plus date/time: ~~~~
* Five tildes gives the date/time alone: ~~~~~


== HTML tags ==

Put text in a <kbd>monospace ('typewriter') font</kbd>. The same font is generally used for <code>computer code</code>.

----

<strike>Strike out</strike> or <u>underline</u> text, or write it <span style="font-variant:small-caps">in small caps</span>.

----

Superscripts and subscripts: X<sup>2</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O

----

<center>Centered text</center>
* Please note the American spelling of "center".

----

* This is how to {{Font color||yellow|highlight part of a sentence}}.

----

<blockquote>
The '''blockquote''' command ''formats'' block quotations, typically by surrounding them with whitespace and a slightly different font.
</blockquote>

----

Invisible comments to editors (<!-- -->) appear only while editing the page.
<!-- Note to editors: blah blah blah. -->


== Organizing your writing ==

== Section headings ==

''Headings'' organize your writing into sections. The ''Wiki'' software can automatically generate a [[help:Section|table of contents]] from them.

=== Subsection ===
Using more "equals" (=) signs creates a subsection.

==== A smaller subsection ====

Don't skip levels, like from two to four equals signs.

Start with 2 equals signs, not 1. If you use only 1 on each side, it will be the equivalent of h1 tags, which should be reserved for page titles.

----

* ''Unordered lists'' are easy to do:
** Start every line with a asterisk.
*** More asterisks indicate a deeper level.
*: Previous item continues.
** A newline
* in a list
marks the end of the list.
*Of course you can start again.

----

# ''Numbered lists'' are:
## Very organized
## Easy to follow
A newline marks the end of the list.
# New numbering starts with 1.

----

Here's a ''definition list'':
; Word : Definition of the word
; A longer phrase needing definition
: Phrase defined
; A word : Which has a definition
: Also a second definition
: And even a third

Begin with a semicolon. One item per line; a newline can appear before the colon, but using a space before the colon improves parsing.

----

* You can even do mixed lists
*# and nest them
*# inside each other
*#* or break lines<br>in lists.
*#; definition lists
*#: can be 
*#:; nested : too

----

: A colon (:) indents a line or paragraph.
A newline starts a new paragraph.
Should only be used on talk pages.
For articles, you probably want the blockquote tag.
: We use 1 colon to indent once.
:: We use 2 colons to indent twice.
::: 3 colons to indent 3 times, and so on.

----

You can make ''horizontal dividing lines'' (----) to separate text.
----
But you should usually use sections instead, so that they go in the table of contents.

----

You can add footnotes to sentences using the ''ref'' tag -- this is especially good for citing a source.

:There are over six billion people in the world.<ref>CIA World Factbook, 2006.</ref>

References: <references/>

For details, see [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] and [[Help:Footnotes]].


== Links ==

Here's a link to a page named [[Official positions|Official position]]. You can even say [[official positions]] and the link will show up correctly.

----

You can put formatting around a link. Example: ''[[Wikipedia]]''.

----

The ''first letter'' of articles is automatically capitalized, so [[wikipedia]] goes to the same place as [[Wikipedia]]. Capitalization matters after the first letter.

----

[[Intentionally permanent red link]] is a page that doesn't exist yet. You could create it by clicking on the link.

----

You can link to a page section by its title:

* [[Doxygen#Doxygen Examples]].

If multiple sections have the same title, add a number. [[#Example section 3]] goes to the third section named "Example section".

----

You can make a link point to a different place with a [[Help:Piped link|piped link]]. Put the link
target first, then the pipe character "|", then the link text.

* [[Help:Link|About Links]]
* [[List of cities by country#Morocco|Cities in Morocco]]

Or you can use the "pipe trick" so that a title that contains disambiguation text will appear with more concise link text.

* [[Spinning (textiles)|]]
* [[Boston, Massachusetts|]]

----

You can make an external link just by typing a URL: http://www.nupedia.com

You can give it a title: [http://www.nupedia.com Nupedia]

Or leave the title blank: [http://www.nupedia.com]

External link can be used to link to a wiki page that cannot be linked to with <nowiki>[[page]]</nowiki>: http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fotonotes&oldid=482030#Installation

----

Linking to an e-mail address works the same way: mailto:someone@example.com or [mailto:someone@example.com someone]

----

#REDIRECT [[Official positions|Official position]]

----

[[Help:Category|Category links]] do not show up in line but instead at page bottom ''and cause the page to be listed in the category.''
[[Category:English documentation]]

Add an extra colon to ''link'' to a category in line without causing the page to be listed in the category:
[[:Category:English documentation]]

----

The Wiki reformats linked dates to match the reader's date preferences. These three dates will show up the
same if you choose a format in your [[Special:Preferences|]]:
* [[1969-07-20]]
* [[July 20]], [[1969]]
* [[20 July]] [[1969]]


== Just show what I typed ==

<nowiki>
The nowiki tag ignores 
[[Wiki]] ''markup''.
It reformats text by 
removing
newlines    and multiple
 spaces.
It still interprets special
characters: &rarr;
</nowiki>

----

<pre>
The pre tag ignores [[Wiki]]
 ''markup''.
It also doesn't     reformat
 text.
It still interprets special
characters: &rarr;
</pre>

----

Leading spaces are another way
to preserve formatting.

 Putting a space at the
 beginning of each
 line stops the text
 from being
 reformatted.  It still 
 interprets [[Wiki]]
 ''markup'' and special
 characters: &rarr;

=== Source code ===

<source lang="csharp">
// Hello World in Microsoft C# ("C-Sharp").

using System;

class HelloWorld
{
    public static int Main(String[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        return 0;
    }
}
</source>


== Images, tables, video, and sounds ==

A picture, including alternate text:

[[Image:Wiki.png|This is Wiki's logo]]

You can put the image in a frame with a caption: [[Image:Wiki.png|frame|This is Wiki's logo]]

----

A link to Wikipedia's page for the image: [[:Image:Wiki.png]]

Or a link directly to the image itself: [[Media:Wiki.png]]

----

Use '''media:''' links to link directly to sounds or videos: [[media:Classical guitar scale.ogg|A sound file]]

----

Provide a spoken rendition of some text in a template:
{{listen
 |title    = Flow, my tears
 |filename = Flow, my tears.ogg
 |filesize = 1.41 MB
}}

----

<span style="border:5px double black">'''Text In a Box'''</span>

----

{| border="10" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="10" align="center"
|-
! This
! is
|- 
| a
| table
|}

=== Galleries ===

<gallery>
Image:Wiki.png
Image:Wiki.png|Captioned
Image:Wiki.png
Image:Wiki.png|[[Wikipedia|Links]] can be put in captions.
</gallery>


== Mathematical formulae ==

<math>\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}</math>


== Templates ==

{{Transclusion demo}}

----

{{Help:Transclusion Demo}}

----

This template takes two parameters, and creates underlined text with a hover box for many modern browsers supporting CSS:

{{H:title|This is the hover text|Hover your mouse over this text}}

Go to this page to see the H:title template itself: {{tl|H:title}}
