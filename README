General Information
===================

This is version 3.24.9 of GtkSourceView.

GtkSourceView is a text widget that extends the standard GTK+ text widget
GtkTextView.

It improves GtkTextView by implementing syntax highlighting and other
features typical of a source code editor.

The official web site is:

    https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView

The GtkSourceView library is free software and is released under the terms of
the GNU Lesser General Public License.


Installation
============

GtkSourceView requires GLib >= 2.48, GTK+ >= 3.20 and libxml2 >= 2.6.

Simple install procedure:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  $ make install

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.

From the Git repository, the 'configure' script and the 'INSTALL' file are not
yet generated, so you need to run 'autogen.sh' instead, which takes the same
arguments as 'configure'.

To build the latest version of GtkSourceView from Git, Jhbuild can be used:
