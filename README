GtkSourceView
=============

This is version 4.0.2 of GtkSourceView.

GtkSourceView is a GNOME library that extends GtkTextView, the standard GTK+
widget for multiline text editing. GtkSourceView adds support for syntax
highlighting, undo/redo, file loading and saving, search and replace, a
completion system, printing, displaying line numbers, and other features
typical of a source code editor.

The GtkSourceView library is free software and is released under the terms of
the GNU Lesser General Public License, see the 'COPYING' file for more details.

The official web site is:

    https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView

Dependencies
------------

* GLib >= 2.48
* GTK+ >= 3.20
* libxml2 >= 2.6

Installation
------------

Simple install procedure from a tarball:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  $ make install

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.

From the Git repository, the 'configure' script and the 'INSTALL' file are not
yet generated, so you need to run 'autogen.sh' instead, which takes the same
arguments as 'configure'.

To build the latest version of GtkSourceView plus its dependencies from Git,
Jhbuild is recommended:
