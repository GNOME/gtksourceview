How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product gtksourceview).
You will need to create an account for yourself.

In the bug report please include:
  
* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What version of GtkSourceView
   - What operating system and version
   - What version of the gtk+, glib and gnome libraries

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occurred.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.
