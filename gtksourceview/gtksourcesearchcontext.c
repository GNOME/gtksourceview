/**
 * GtkSourceSearchContext:
 *
 * Search context.
 *
 * A `GtkSourceSearchContext` is used for the search and replace in a
 * [class@Buffer]. The search settings are represented by a
 * [class@SearchSettings] object. There can be a many-to-many relationship
 * between buffers and search settings, with the search contexts in-between: a
 * search settings object can be shared between several search contexts; and a
 * buffer can contain several search contexts at the same time.
 *
 * The total number of search occurrences can be retrieved with
 * [method@SearchContext.get_occurrences_count]. To know the position of a
 * certain match, use [method@SearchContext.get_occurrence_position].
 *
 * The buffer is scanned asynchronously, so it doesn't block the user interface.
 * For each search, the buffer is scanned at most once. After that, navigating
 * through the occurrences doesn't require to re-scan the buffer entirely.
 *
 * To search forward, use [method@SearchContext.forward] or
 * [method@SearchContext.forward_async] for the asynchronous version.
 * The backward search is done similarly. To replace a search match, or all
 * matches, use [method@SearchContext.replace] and
 * [method@SearchContext.replace_all].
 *
 * The search occurrences are highlighted by default. To disable it, use
 * [method@SearchContext.set_highlight]. You can enable the search
 * highlighting for several `GtkSourceSearchContext`s attached to the
 * same buffer. Moreover, each of those `GtkSourceSearchContext`s can
 * have a different text style associated. Use
 * [method@SearchContext.set_match_style] to specify the [class@Style]
 * to apply on search matches.
 *
 * Note that the [property@SearchContext:highlight] and
 * [property@SearchContext:match-style] properties are in the
 * `GtkSourceSearchContext` class, not [class@SearchSettings]. Appearance
 * settings should be tied to one, and only one buffer, as different buffers can
 * have different style scheme associated (a [class@SearchSettings] object
 * can be bound indirectly to several buffers).
 *
 * The concept of "current match" doesn't exist yet. A way to highlight
 * differently the current match is to select it.
 *
 * A search occurrence's position doesn't depend on the cursor position or other
 * parameters. Take for instance the buffer "aaaa" with the search text "aa".
 * The two occurrences are at positions [0:2] and [2:4]. If you begin to search
 * at position 1, you will get the occurrence [2:4], not [1:3]. This is a
 * prerequisite for regular expression searches. The pattern ".*" matches the
 * entire line. If the cursor is at the middle of the line, you don't want the
 * rest of the line as the occurrence, you want an entire line. (As a side note,
 * regular expression searches can also match multiple lines.)
 *
 * In the GtkSourceView source code, there is an example of how to use the
 * search and replace API: see the tests/test-search.c file. It is a mini
 * application for the search and replace, with a basic user interface.
 */

/* Implementation overview:
 *
 * When the state of the search changes (the text to search or the options), we
 * have to update the highlighting and the properties values (the number of
 * occurrences). To do so, a simple solution is to first remove all the
 * found_tag, so we have a clean buffer to analyze. The problem with this
 * solution is that there is some flickering when the user modifies the text to
 * search, because removing all the found_tag's can take some time. So we keep
 * the old found_tag's, and when we must highlight the matches in a certain
 * region, we first remove the found_tag's in this region and then we highlight
 * the newly found matches by applying the found_tag to them.
 *
 * If we only want to highlight the matches, without counting the number of
 * occurrences, a good solution would be to highlight only the visible region of
 * the buffer on the screen. So it would be useless to always scan all the
 * buffer.
 *
 * But we actually want the number of occurrences! So we have to scan all the
 * buffer. When the state of the search changes, an idle callback is installed,
 * which will scan the buffer to highlight the matches. To avoid flickering, the
 * visible region on the screen is put in a higher priority region to highlight,
 * so the idle callback will first scan this region.
 *
 * Why highlighting the non-visible matches? What we want is to (1) highlight
 * the visible matches and (2) count the number of occurrences. The code would
 * indeed be simpler if these two tasks were clearly separated (in two different
 * idle callbacks, with different regions to scan). With this simpler solution,
 * we would always use forward_search() and backward_search() to navigate
 * through the occurrences. But we can do better than that!
 * forward_to_tag_toggle() and backward_to_tag_toggle() are far more efficient:
 * once the buffer has been scanned, going to the previous or the next
 * occurrence is done in O(log n), with n the length of the buffer. We must just
 * pay attention to contiguous matches.
 *
 * While the user is typing the text in the search entry, the buffer is scanned
 * to count the number of occurrences. And when the user wants to do an
 * operation (go to the next occurrence for example), chances are that the
 * buffer has already been scanned entirely, so almost all the operations will
 * be really fast.
 *
 * Extreme example:
 * <occurrence> [1 GB of text] <next-occurrence>
 * Once the buffer is scanned, switching between the occurrences will be almost
 * instantaneous.
 *
 * So how to count the number of occurrences then? Remember that the buffer
 * contents can be modified during the scan, and that we keep the old
 * found_tag's. Moreover, when we encounter an old found_tag region, in the
 * general case we can not say how many occurrences there are in this region,
 * since a found_tag region can contain contiguous matches. Take for example the
 * found_tag region "aa": was it the "aa" search match, or two times "a"?
 * The implemented solution is to set occurrences_count to 0 when the search
 * state changes, even if old matches are still there. Because it is not
 * possible to count the old matches to decrement occurrences_count (and storing
 * the previous search text would not be sufficient, because even older matches
 * can still be there). To increment and decrement occurrences_count, there is
 * the scan_region, the region to scan. If an occurrence is contained in
 * scan_region, it means that it has not already been scanned, so
 * occurrences_count doesn't take into account this occurrence. On the other
 * hand, if we find an occurrence outside scan_region, the occurrence is
 * normally correctly highlighted, and occurrences_count take it into account.
 *
 * So when we highlight or when we remove the highlight of an occurrence (on
 * text insertion, deletion, when scanning, etc.), we increment or decrement
 * occurrences_count depending on whether the occurrence was already taken into
 * account by occurrences_count.
 *
 * If the code seems too complicated and contains strange bugs, you have two
 * choices:
 * - Write more unit tests, understand correctly the code and fix it.
 * - Rewrite the code to implement the simpler solution explained above :-)
 *   But with the simpler solution, multiple-lines regex search matches (see
 *   below) would not be possible for going to the previous occurrence (or the
 *   buffer must always be scanned from the beginning).
 *
 * Known issue
 * -----------
 *
 * Contiguous matches have a performance problem. In some cases it can lead to
 * an O(N^2) time complexity. For example if the buffer is full of contiguous
 * matches, and we want to navigate through all of them. If an iter is in the
 * middle of a found_tag region, we don't know where are the nearest occurrence
 * boundaries. Take for example the buffer "aaaa" with the search text "aa". The
 * two occurrences are at positions [0:2] and [2:4]. If we begin to search at
 * position 1, we can not take [1:3] as an occurrence. So what the code do is to
 * go backward to the start of the found_tag region, and do a basic search
 * inside the found_tag region to find the occurrence boundaries.
 *
 * So this is really a corner case, but it's better to be aware of that.
 * To fix the problem, one solution would be to have two found_tag, and
 * alternate them for contiguous matches.
 */

/* Regex search:
 *
 * With a regex, we don't know how many lines a match can span. A regex will
 * most probably match only one line, but a regex can contain something like
 * "\n*", or the dot metacharacter can also match newlines, with the "?s" option
 * (see G_REGEX_DOTALL).
 * Therefore a simple solution is to always begin the search at the beginning of
 * the document. Only the scan_region is taken into account for scanning the
 * buffer.
 *
 * For non-regex searches, when there is an insertion or deletion in the buffer,
 * we don't need to re-scan all the buffer. If there is an unmodified match in
 * the neighborhood, no need to re-scan it (unless at_word_boundaries is set).
 * For a regex search, it is more complicated. An insertion or deletion outside
 * a match can modify a match located in the neighborhood. Take for example the
 * regex "(aa)+" with the buffer contents "aaa". There is one occurrence: the
 * first two letters. If we insert an extra 'a' at the end of the buffer, the
 * occurrence is modified to take the next two letters. That's why the buffer
 * is re-scanned entirely on each insertion or deletion in the buffer.
 *
 * For searching the matches, the easiest solution is to retrieve all the buffer
 * contents, and search the occurrences on this big string. But it takes a lot
 * of memory space. It is better to do multi-segment matching, also called
 * incremental matching. See the pcrepartial(3) manpage. The matching is done
 * segment by segment, with the G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL_HARD flag (for reasons
 * explained in the manpage). We begin by the first segment of the buffer as the
 * subject string. If a partial match is returned, we append the next segment to
 * the subject string, and we try again to find a complete match. When a
 * complete match is returned, we must continue to search the next occurrences.
 * The max lookbehind of the pattern must be retrieved. The start of the next
 * subject string is located at max_lookbehind characters before the end of the
 * previously found match. Similarly, if no match is found (neither a complete
 * match nor a partial match), we take the next segment, with the last
 * max_lookbehind characters from the previous segment.
 *
 * Improvement idea
 * ----------------
 *
 * What we would like to support in applications is the incremental search:
 * while we type the pattern, the buffer is scanned and the matches are
 * highlighted. When the pattern is not fully typed, strange things can happen,
 * including a pattern that match the entire buffer. And if the user is
 * working on a really big file, catastrophe: the UI is blocked!
 * To avoid this problem, a solution is to search the buffer differently
 * depending on the situation:
 * - First situation: the subject string to scan is small enough, we retrieve it
 *   and scan it directly.
 * - Second situation: the subject string to scan is too big, it will take
 *   too much time to retrieve it and scan it directly. We handle this situation
 *   in three phases: (1) retrieving the subject string, chunks by chunks, in
 *   several idle loop iterations. (2) Once the subject string is retrieved
 *   completely, we launch the regex matching in a thread. (3) Once the thread
 *   is finished, we highlight the matches in the buffer. And voilà.
 *
 * But in practice, when trying a pattern that match the entire buffer, we
 * quickly get an error like:
 *
 * 	Regex matching error: Error while matching regular expression (.*\n)*:
 * 	recursion limit reached
 *
 * It happens with test-search, with this file as the buffer (~3500 lines).
 *
 * Improvement idea
 * ----------------
 *
 * GRegex currently doesn't support JIT pattern compilation:
 * https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=679155
 *
 * Once available, it can be a nice performance improvement (but it must be
 * measured, since g_regex_new() is slower with JIT enabled).
 *
 * Known issue
 * -----------
 *
 * To search at word boundaries, \b is added at the beginning and at the
 * end of the pattern. But \b is not the same as
 * _gtk_source_iter_starts_extra_natural_word() and
 * _gtk_source_iter_ends_extra_natural_word(). \b for
 * example doesn't take the underscore as a word boundary.
 * Using _gtk_source_iter_starts_extra_natural_word() and ends_word() for regex searches
 * is not easily possible: if the GRegex returns a match, but doesn't
 * start and end a word, maybe a shorter match (for a greedy pattern)
 * start and end a word, or a longer match (for an ungreedy pattern). To
 * be able to use the _gtk_source_iter_starts_extra_natural_word() and ends_word()
 * functions for regex search, g_regex_match_all_full() must be used, to
 * retrieve _all_ matches, and test the word boundaries until a match is
 * found at word boundaries.
